## Notes
**Vampire Slayer:** We do not recommend buying vampire carries, as they are very difficult to survive and there generally isn't much the carrier can do. However, we will try our best to help you kill the boss.
**Blaze Slayer:** You will likely need Sorrow Armor to grind kills to spawn the boss
## Discounts
**50%** off all carries under 4m and **25%** off everything else for guild members
